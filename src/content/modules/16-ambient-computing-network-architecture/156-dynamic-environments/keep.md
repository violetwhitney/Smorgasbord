# Dynamic Environments
## Module Summary
In this module you will get an intro to dynamic environments, and understand some of the basic methods and fields when working with environments that are "web connected" and change dynamically based on **"states"**.

## Conceptual Introduction, or: Why is this interesting / important?
Explaining, designing and engineering products that interact between the physical and digital world can be counter-intuitive. The following are a collection of common diagram types which have helped me explain and design physical-digital interactions. Each diagram type helps explain unique dimensions within the complexity of todays digitally and physically interconnected world.

**Assembly** — shows how a system’s comprised parts are assembled. This separation of each component part facilitates this understanding and can include additional specifications on dimensions and item ids for each component. Assembly drawings also sometimes include instructions and sequencing as seen in Ikea drawings.

**Rube Goldberg** — show sequence of events in a complicated often impractical contraptions that creates a simple action.

**Patent** — illustrates a patent invention, and its components. Many patent drawings are also assembly drawings. Patent drawings are heavily notated to describe component pieces, cross referenced in legends and reports.

**Tech Stack** — shows how software products and programming languages are inter-related to create a web or mobile application.

**Flow Diagram** — shows sequence of movements or actions of people or things involved in a complex system.

**Decision Tree** — organizes decisions into branches and their possible consequences.

**User Journey** — explains how an individual user of a particular product or service experiences a series of interactions (touch points) along a journey in aim of a particular outcome from their use of the product or service.

**User Flow** — show paths in a user interface which a typical user will follow using a website or app.

**Ergonomics** —shows how a product is optimized for the human body, i.e. how its characteristics, such as proportions, weight, responds to the human hearing, sight, temperature preferences, etc.

**Organizational** — shows the structure of an organization/institution/nation and the relative relationships of its people, parts or positions.

## Tutorial

1. **Download Processing.**  
Place [Processing](https://processing.org/download) in the Applications folder on your computer (or Program Files for Windows). When you double click Processing, it should install and launch the application with a new empty sketch. A sketch is where you will write your code. We’ll be writing code in Java inside of Processing.
