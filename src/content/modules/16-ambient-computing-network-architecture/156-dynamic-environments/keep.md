## Tutorial

1. **Download Processing.**  
Place [Processing](https://processing.org/download) in the Applications folder on your computer (or Program Files for Windows). When you double click Processing, it should install and launch the application with a new empty sketch. A sketch is where you will write your code. Weâ€™ll be writing code in Java inside of Processing.
