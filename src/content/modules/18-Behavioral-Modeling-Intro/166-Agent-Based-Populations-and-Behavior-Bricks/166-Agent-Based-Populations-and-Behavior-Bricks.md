Behavioral Modeling:
===========================================

# Agent Based Modeling and Behavior Bricks
## Module Summary

In this tutorial we will use Behavior Bricks (a plugin for character animation) in Unity to create 2 simple agents: an interactive Player (moved around using mouse clicks), and an Agent that wanders around, and pursues the player when it sees them. We’ll cover the following core concepts:

1. Setting Up Behavior Bricks
2. Creating A Behavior
3. Editing Behavior Parameters
4. Composing Behaviors
5. Conditions & Perceptions


## Conceptual Introduction
Behavior Bricks is a character animation plugin for Unity the gaming engine.
What is quite useful about Behavior Bricks and character animation apps like it, is that it allows us to program behavior of an agent with high level programming. Behavior Bricks uses a node based Visual Programming Language (akin to Grasshopper) to program things like character movement, following, or other actions based on other triggers. This will be particularly useful for understanding how behaviors are related to one another in an agent based model.
